# Multimodal Lung Diagnosis AI

## 📌 Overview

Multimodal Lung Diagnosis AI is a deep learning–based medical diagnosis system that combines **chest X-ray images** and **clinical text reports** to detect lung diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19.
Traditional AI models often use only one type of data, which can reduce accuracy. This project integrates image analysis and natural language understanding to provide more reliable and explainable results.

The system is designed with two interaction modes:

* **Doctor Mode** – detailed analysis, severity prediction, and visual explanations.
* **Patient Mode** – simplified summaries and easy-to-understand guidance.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Improve diagnostic accuracy using multimodal learning.
* Support doctors with AI-assisted decision making.
* Provide patients with accessible preliminary insights.
* Reduce workload in high-demand healthcare environments.
* Increase transparency through explainable AI outputs.
